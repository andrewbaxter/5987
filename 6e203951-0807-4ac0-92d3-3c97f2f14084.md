# Identifiers and Descriptors

The terms identifier and descriptor have more general meanings than I'm using here, but I find them useful for contrasting two concepts that are frequently mixed up.

An **identifier** is a piece of text used to uniquely refer to something.

A **descriptor** is a piece of text used to give a human an intuitive sense of what something is.

A descriptor may be something like "database server", "west wing access point", or "region-database". Assuming there's only one access point in the west wing, "west wing access point" also seems like a decent identifier, which is where the confusion arises.

## The problem

Descriptors make bad identifiers.

- It's hard to come up with good descriptors.

  Aside from typos and other mistakes, maybe you realize the descriptor is ambiguous later. Like this blog - I couldn't figure out if it was a blog or some sort of collected essays thing, and I was hoping to have a more "this is what I worked on this week" type blog separately, later. The repository name shows up in the URL, so if I chose wrong I'm left with two options: keep the bad name forever, or change it and change everything that referred to it, possibly getting things wrong and causing issues down the line if you missed one, and hoping external links get updated by people who care.

- Descriptors can become ambiguous as the surroundings change.

  If the west wing gets another access point, "west wing access point" is no longer unambiguous. And worse, you may not know which of the two access points was the one documents were originally referring to.

- Descriptors can be relative.

  Suppose your company has a provisioning team, and some new work comes up where you need to tell someone in that team which server to use: "database server" may be ambiguous to you, but maybe multiple divisions have database servers and the provisioning team works with all of them - the descriptor doesn't function as an identifier in this communication.

So descriptors can and will change, and things may even have multiple descriptors. Even with huge amounts of foresight and experience things can happen outside your control that necessitate change.

If identifiers change, on the other hand, it causes problems.

### Problems in the real world

- Human names

  Many systems, private and public, make assumptions about names: that your name doesn't change, that the name written first is your "first name", that your last name is shared with your family.

  All of these are wrong and routinely cause issues.

  divorice difficulties
  foreign names
  wrongful association (airport security)

- Domain names

  People need a way to refer to servers other than IP addresses, because IP addresses can and do change frequently. IP addresses are tied to ISPs, so you can't take an IP with you if you move providers. Domain names were a level of indirection so you could have a persistent identifier with changing IPs.

  Right off the bat though, the authors munged them with descriptors, like `symbolics.com`, setting the stage for decades of issues:

  - A domain name as a marketing asset
  - Names are a scarce resource, hoarded by large actors and pricing new entrants out of an important marketing device
  - Extortionary pricing by registrars and IANA
  - Renames contributing to broken links
  - Lost names due to registrar technical incompetence
  - Lost names due to foul play and politics
  - Domain squatting
  - Typo squatting

- URLs

  broken bookmarks
  unnecessary dead links
  cool urls don't change, wrong - solution isn't to be more careful
  apis, poorly named endpoints

- Variable names
  boilerplate renaming something
  rename refactoring can't handle macros, etc
- Filenames
  bad names: usr doen't store user data, appdata, library
  using hierarchy for organization, not good, lots of shuffling - broken references (links, bookmarks, playlists)
- Email addresses
  can't change your email
  school email rolling back given emails, name depletion
- Resource identifiers in IaaS
  servers

## The solution (almost)

Identifiers should be randomly generated, like with the UUID schema. This is easy and doesn't take much thought (aside from how much storage space you have).

Descriptors should be a second layer on top of the identifiers, managed individually and freely changeable.

### Exaples of successful separation

- AWS instances

  AWS doesn't do this across the board (I can only assume they have some monstrous technical debt), but in EC2 instances have an AWS-assigned random identifier like `i-abcdefgh1234` and a _separate_ descriptor using the `Name` tag.

  Anywhere unambiguity is needed, like API calls and audits, the ID is used.

  In the UI however, the `Name` tag is displayed by default many places

- Phone numbers

  Phone numbers have always been meaningless, and with migration, population expansion, number depletion etc. that's even more cemented.

  Most everyone calls eachother using address book software which manages the mapping of names to phone numbers. When you make a call, you choose the name, and the phone provides the number. When you receive a call, the phone checks your address book and tells you who it is.

### It's a hard sell

This solution isn't without drawbacks, some real, some semireal, and some unreal.

1. It takes more code.

   Any software, user interfaces, etc that deal with identifiers need systems for displaying and managing associated descriptors.

   For instance, if any interfaces to a system rely on plain text (text files, etc) there's no way to implement a separate layer. You can just use the identifiers, but this makes editing hard.

   I strongly believe we need to invest more in making smart(er) tooling easier to create, but we're not there yet.

2. We rely on descriptors for trust

   With DNS and URLs, the descriptor is used as a trust mechanism. Generally speaking, shorter domain names with older TLDs such as `.com` and `.net` are more trustworthy.
